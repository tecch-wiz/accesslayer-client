///
/// # Stability and Ordering
///
/// **IMPORTANT**: New error variants MUST be appended to the end of this enum and NEVER
/// inserted mid-enum. The numeric discriminant values are part of the contract's ABI and
/// are exposed to clients, indexers, and monitoring tools.
///
/// ## Consequences of Reordering
///
/// If a variant is inserted mid-enum or existing variants are reordered:
/// - Existing clients that match on numeric error codes will break
/// - Indexers and monitoring tools will misinterpret error types
/// - Historical error logs will become inconsistent with current definitions
/// - Contract upgrades will introduce silent behavioral changes
///
/// ## Safe Extension Pattern
///
/// ✅ **Correct**: Append new variants at the end
/// ```rust,ignore
/// pub enum ContractError {
///     AlreadyRegistered = 1,
///     NotRegistered = 2,
///     // ... existing variants ...
///     InvalidHandleCharacter = 14,
///     NewError = 15,  // ✅ Safe: appended at end
/// }
/// ```

/// ❌ **Incorrect**: Insert mid-enum
/// ```rust,ignore
/// pub enum ContractError {
///     AlreadyRegistered = 1,
///     NewError = 2,  // ❌ BREAKS ABI: shifts all subsequent variants
